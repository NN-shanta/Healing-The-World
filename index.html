        <p>
          People are hungry, unsure where the next meal will come from and can
          not even dare to go swimming in search of food for fear of
          electrocution. They have no access to clean and safe drinking water.
          Houses went under waist-deep water.
        </p>
        <p>
          People watch helplessly and in utter despair as the places they once
          called their homes vanish right in front of their eyes.

          A relentless downpour crippled Bangladesh’s northeast over the past
          week, and Bangladesh Army, Airforce and Navy were sent to evacuate
          households cut off from neighbouring communities. More than four
          million people have been stranded by flood water, and nearly the
          entire region was without electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The downpours have caused extensive damage to thousands of houses,
          water sources, food stores, farmland and roads.
